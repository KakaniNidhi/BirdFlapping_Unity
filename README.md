# BirdFlapping_Unity
## This repo contains my first game, "Flappy Bird" in C# built using Unity engine.
### Make the bird appear on screen
### Make it drop
### Make it flap
### Make a gameObject
### Give it a sprite renderer
### Animation controller for flapping
### Rigid body so it falls
### Box collider to make it hit into pipes
### Script so that whenever it hit into pipes
### Make pipes
### Turn it into prefabricated game objects
### Spawn them
### Finally make the cheat code i.e. to make the bird still and make the pipes move.
### Clouds flying
### Sound effects
